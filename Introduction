1.	Introduction:

1.1.	Background

New York City, one of the biggest cities in the United States and one of the liveliest, has always been known for their restaurants, who are happy to serve both residents as well as tourists. There are more than 27,043 restaurants in New York City, which makes the competition very hard, and it will become more and more fierce once restaurants will be able to reopen, after quarantine is over. French Cuisine has always been of interests for Americans, and it has been back in style in recent years. Many French cooks, such as Alain Ducasse or Gilles Verot, have open restaurant in the Big Apple, and their restaurants are almost always full of reservations. 

1.2.	Problem

Using analytics, restaurants are able to make strategic decisions based on insights gained on a specific region or city. Because of the high price of the menus, that often comes in hand with the sophistication of this cuisine, it is of utmost important to find the right place for people to come and eat. Therefore, this project will be able to identify an ideal business location for a French restaurant by considering areas that have a high frequency of residents, but a low frequency of other French restaurants. 

1.3.	Interest

Obviously, a restaurant owner looking to open a new French restaurant will be the primary target for this project. But this project can also serve the purpose of answering the question: “where is the best place to stay, in order to enjoy French cuisine?”. The methodology could also be replicable for any kind of restaurants or cuisine.
